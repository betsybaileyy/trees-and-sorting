## Iterative Sorting Algorithms

#### Iterative sorting algorithms check that a list is in sorted order. If a list is not in sorted order the algorithm should re-arrage it into sorted order. 

##### Can we count how many **inversions** are in a list?
- *An inversion is anytime two elements in a list are not in their natural order.* 
#### Classic Iterative Sorting Algorithms:
1.  **Bubble Sort** 🛁
Sort given items by swapping adjacent items that are out of order, and
repeating until all items are in sorted order.
2. **Selection Sort:** Sort given items by finding minimum item, swapping it with first
    unsorted item, and repeating until all items are in sorted order.
3. **Insertion Sort:** Sort given items by taking first unsorted item, inserting it in sorted
    order in front of items, and repeating until all items are in order.
