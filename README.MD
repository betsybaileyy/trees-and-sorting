## Iterative Sorting Algorithms

#### Iterative sorting algorithms check that a list is in sorted order. If a list is not in sorted order the algorithm should re-arrage it into sorted order. 

##### Count how many **inversions** are in a list.
- An inversion is anytime two elements in a list are not in their natural order. 
#### Classic Iterative Sorting Algorithms:
- bubble sort
- selection sort
- insertion sort
